"IDIOT"
— And let me, with whom I have the honor
— Prince Lev Nikolaevich Myshkin
— Prince Myshkin? Lev Nikolaevich? I don't know. So I didn't even hear it
— Oh, still!
hahaha
— There are no Princes Myshkins at all now, except for me; I think I'm the last one
— He-he-he! The last of its kind! Hehe! How did you turn it aroun.
The black man chuckled too. The fair-haired man was somewhat surprised that he managed to say, however, rather badly, a pun
Imagine, I didn't even think about it
But imagine, I said it without thinking at all, he finally explained in surprise.
— Yes, it’s understandable, sir, it’s understandable, the official assented cheerfully.
— And why did you, prince, study the sciences there, with a professor? the black man suddenly asked.
— Yes ... studied ...
— But I never learned anything.
— But I’m the same way, just for something, the prince added, almost in apology. Due to illness, they did not find it possible to systematically teach me.
Do you know the Rogozhins? the black man asked quickly.
— No, I don't know, not at all. I know very few people in Russia. Are you Rogozhin?
— Yes, me, Rogozhin, Parfyon.
— Parfion? Yes, these are not the same Rogozhins ... — the official began with heightened importance.
— Yes, those, the same, the black — haired, who, however, had never turned to the opposed official, quickly and with impatient impatience, and from the very beginning spoke only to one prince.
— Yes…how is that? — the official was surprised to the point of tetanus and almost bulged his eyes, whose whole face immediately began to take shape in something reverent, and obsequious, even frightened, — this is the same Semyon Parfenovich Rogozhin, a hereditary honorary citizen, who died a month ago and two and a half million capital left?
— And how did you know that he left two and a half million net worth?
He lay in a fever in Pskov for the whole month.
— And now you have to get a million dollars more than once, and at least that, oh my God!” The official threw up his hands.
— Well, what is he, tell me, please! — Rogozhin nodded irritably and angrily at him again, — after all, I won’t give you a penny, even if you walk upside down in front of me here.
- And I will, and I will walk.
— Vish! Why, I won’t give it, I won’t give it, if you like, dance for a whole week!
— And don’t! That's what I need; do not give! And I will dance. I will leave my wife and small children, and I will dance in front of you. Flatter, flatter!
- Fuck you!(Tfu tebya...)!
